# NHL-tracker
Using data read from provided text files regarding NHL team statistics, track wins and losses per playoff round to determine which team won the championship by updating nodes in a binary tree. 

This was the final assignment for my Intro to CS Fundamentals II course, intended to strengthen algorithm design, traverse binary trees, build tree structures, implement helper methods, and manipulate data read from external files. 

Files I authored: HockeySeries.java, Playoffs.java, TreeBuilder.java

Note: run and inspect the test files, TestTreeBuilder.java and TestPlayoffs.java to see how the program works.
